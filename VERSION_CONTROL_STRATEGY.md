# DocFlow4 Version Control & Deployment Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive version control, branching, deployment, and testing strategy for the DocFlow4 application using AWS Amplify multi-environment architecture.

## Current Environment Mapping

### Branch → Environment Mapping
```
dev001  → Development (+ Sandbox 00012)
sit     → System Integration Test
uat     → User Acceptance Test  
main    → Production
```

### Environment Configuration
- **Development (dev001)**: Active development branch with sandbox environment
- **SIT (sit)**: Automated integration testing with full backend
- **UAT (uat)**: User acceptance testing with production-like data
- **Production (main)**: Live production environment

## Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production)
├── uat (user acceptance testing)
├── sit (system integration testing)  
└── dev001 (development)
    └── feature/* (feature branches)
    └── bugfix/* (bug fix branches)
    └── hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
```

### Branch Protection Rules

#### Main Branch (Production)
- **Required Reviews**: 1 reviewers minimum
- **Required Status Checks**: 
  - All tests passing
  - SIT validation complete
  - UAT approval complete
  - Security scan passed
- **No Direct Pushes**: All changes via PR only
- **Admin Override**: Only for emergency hotfixes

#### UAT Branch
- **Required Reviews**: 1 reviewer minimum  
- **Required Status Checks**:
  - SIT tests passing
  - Integration tests complete
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge from SIT

#### SIT Branch  
- **Required Reviews**: 1 reviewer minimum
- **Required Status Checks**:
  - Unit tests passing
  - E2E tests passing
  - Code coverage > 80%
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge from dev001

#### Dev001 Branch
- **Required Reviews**: 1 reviewer (can be bypassed by admins)
- **Required Status Checks**:
  - Unit tests passing
  - Linting passed
- **Merge Strategy**: Merge commits for feature tracking

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development
1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev001
   git pull origin dev001
   git checkout -b feature/DOCF-123-user-management
   ```

2. **Development Process**
   - Work on feature with regular commits
   - Use sandbox environment: `npm run sandbox`
   - Run tests locally: `npm run test:all`
   - Keep branch up to date: `git rebase dev001`

3. **Feature Complete**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/DOCF-123-user-management
   # Create PR to dev001
   ```

### Integration Workflow

    C --> D[UAT]
    D --> E[main]
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Critical production fix
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-fix
# Make minimal fix
git commit -m "hotfix: critical production issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-fix
# Create PR directly to main (bypass normal flow)
```

### Rollback Process  
```bash
# Production rollback
git checkout main
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Environment rollback
# Use AWS Amplify console for immediate rollback
# Or deploy previous known-good commit
```

### Incident Response
1. **Identify Issue**: Monitoring alerts or user reports
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine severity and affected users  
3. **Implement Fix**: Hotfix process or rollback
4. **Validate Resolution**: Automated and manual testing
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Documentation and process improvement
