# Production User Creation Guide

This guide explains how to create users in the production AWS environment.

## Why Test Users Aren't Created in Deployment

AWS Amplify's build role doesn't have `cognito-idp:AdminCreateUser` permissions by default. This is intentional for security - production user creation should be controlled.

## Options for Production Users

### Option 1: Self-Registration (Recommended)
Users can register themselves through the application:
1. Go to the application login page
2. Click "Create account"
3. Enter email and password
4. Verify email with the sent code
5. Log in normally

### Option 2: Admin Creation via AWS Console
1. Go to AWS Cognito in the AWS Console
2. Find your User Pool (search for your app name)
3. Click "Users" â†’ "Create user"
4. Enter email and temporary password
5. User must change password on first login

### Option 3: AWS CLI (for admins)
```bash
# Get your User Pool ID from amplify_outputs.json
aws cognito-idp admin-create-user \
  --user-pool-id YOUR_USER_POOL_ID \
  --username user@example.com \
  --user-attributes Name=email,Value=user@example.com \
  --temporary-password "TempPass123!" \
  --message-action SUPPRESS
```

### Option 4: Local Test Users (Development Only)
For local development, test users can be created:
```bash
# In your local environment
AWS_PROFILE=your_profile node scripts/create-test-users.js
```

## Production User Management

- Users should register through the application UI
- Admin users need to be assigned roles after registration
- Use the built-in user management features in the admin panel
- Never hardcode production credentials

## Security Notes

- Test user creation is disabled in production for security
- Use proper IAM roles and policies
- Enable MFA for admin accounts
- Regular user access reviews recommended
